### Instructions

Please first use anaconda prompt to create the environment.

`conda env create --file environment.yml`

then unzip the event log in example_logs/mdl/ and put it in the same directory.

Activate the environment in anaconda prompt

`conda activate icsoc`

Go into the repository directory and run

`python experiments.py`

This will run all the experiments and reproduce the figures. Slight deviations might be due to differently initialized weights in the neural networks.

Note: To use the DGL library, you additionally have to place a config file in

`~\.dgl\config.json`

containing only the line
`{"backend":"tensorflow"}`

There might be an error if the environment was installed with a wrong version of a package.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72441758/typeerror-descriptors-cannot-not-be-created-directly

run
`pip install protobuf==3.20.*`
in that case.
