# SELF REMINDER. Copy the 'ocpa' directory to the forked one from github, so that I can push updates to github.

## Questions I have for Niklas and Gyunam
- Is it guaranteed that the statistics are correct when using tabular/sequential encoding? (e.g. rem_time, since due to divergence/convergence/deficiency numbers can be incorrect)
- Why did you normalize the target variable?
- How actively are you maintaining the ocpa library? (I have made some contributions in a forked version)
    - Do you have an overview of the maturity? (i.e. do you know what does/doesn't work and what you have planned to implement)
    - Can we work together to mature the library?
- What are your advancements in ML/GNN applications on OCEL?
